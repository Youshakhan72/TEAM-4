How It Works:
It asks you for:

Your name

Your job title

A list of skills (separated by commas)

Your previous experience

It formats the info into a clean, readable resume layout using an f-string.

It saves the resume into a file called resume.txt.

Finally, it shows:
 "Resume saved to resume.txt"
