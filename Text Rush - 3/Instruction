How the Game Works:
1. Start the Game
When you run the game, it shows a background image and starts background music.

A few random words appear on the right side of the screen and start moving left slowly.

2. Your Goal
You need to type the exact word you see on the screen in the input box at the bottom.

Then press Enter to submit.

3. If You Type a Word Correctly
That word disappears.

Your score increases by 10 points.

The words move a bit faster.

A sound plays for success.

4. If a Word Reaches the Left Edge
You lose a life (you start with 15 lives).

If all lives are lost, the game ends and plays a “game over” sound.

5. Leveling Up
Every 50 points, your level increases, and one new word is added.

6. Game Over
You’ll see a "GAME OVER" message.

You can press:

R to restart the game.

Q to quit the game.
